# Finance Tracker 📋

Welcome to the Finance Tracker project! This project is a great place for beginners looking to make their first contributions to open source. We're using Python's `tkinter` module, with the aim of turning this into a web application. All skill levels are welcome!

* Implement a database to persist user data. This addition will significantly improve the application's utility by allowing users to maintain their finance records across sessions.
* Migrate the application to a web-based platform using frameworks like Django or Flask. This shift would increase the accessibility of the application and provide opportunities to explore web development principles and practices.
